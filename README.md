# React Portfolio
Rebuild portfolio in React

## The problem
Tech: React, jsx, styled components, created my own JSON to fetch project data

Met Requirements:

✓ The app is built with React and Styled Components

✓ The app has reusable components and reusable styled components

✓ The app look close to the given design

✓ The app fetches data in JSON format

If I had more time / What I will continue adding: 

+ Make it responsive
+ Solve overlay issues for project images
+ Replace styling placeholders with wanted properties
+ Iterate on styling across project
+ Snap a new and updated profile picture
+ Create custom domain for portfolio
